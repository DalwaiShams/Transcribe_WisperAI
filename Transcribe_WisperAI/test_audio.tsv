0	5440	Hello everyone, I'm Shams Del Wai, a proud member of Metamorphs, and today I'm thrilled to present
5440	10320	one of the most exciting projects we've been working on, a solution that converts any audio
10320	16800	file into a text file. Our team, Metamorphs, is dedicated to creating innovative and transformative
16800	23440	technologies, and this project is no exception. In the digital era, the need to convert audio data
23440	28480	into readable text is more critical than ever. Whether you're transcribing meetings, converting
28480	34240	podcasts, or processing spoken content for analysis, transforming audio into text brings
34240	40240	efficiency and accessibility. This project was born out of the desire to make audio content
40240	46720	easier to manipulate, analyze, and repurpose across various domains. From creating searchable
46720	51760	archives of interviews and lectures to enabling real-time transcription in education or business
51760	55760	settings, the scope of this technology is far-reaching.
